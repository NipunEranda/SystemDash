# Rust Web API

This project is a simple web API built with Rust using the Tokio runtime and Warp framework. It demonstrates how to set up an asynchronous HTTP server and define routes with corresponding request handlers.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Rust and Cargo installed on your machine. You can install them by following the instructions at [rust-lang.org](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

### Building the Project

To build the project, navigate to the project directory and run:

```
cargo build
```

### Running the API

To run the API, use the following command:

```
cargo run
```

The server will start and listen for incoming requests.

### API Endpoints

- Define your API endpoints in `src/routes/mod.rs`.
- Implement the request handling logic in `src/handlers/mod.rs`.
